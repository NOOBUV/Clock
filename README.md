Made it using HTML and Css(animations), in this project i learnt to use CSS animations and the use of transform property of css. It was a fun project with my team in devsnest. We all put our imagination into these clocks and made them look astonishing. If you want to give a look on mine here is the link --> https://elated-tesla-b1b478.netlify.app/
